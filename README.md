The primary objective of this project was to implement and analyze the image filtering techniques proposed in Chang and Wang’s research paper “Propagated Image Filtering” (CVPR 2015). The project involves implementing classic filters, including bilateral, guided and geodesic filters as baselines, followed by the implementation of the proposed propagation filter, to compare its performance and advantages. Experiments were conducted on various computer vision tasks, including image denoising, image smoothing, flash/no flash denoising and image fusion. For each task, the performance of all the filters was evaluated and compared using the PSNR, to validate the effectiveness of the propagation filter in preserving image details while accomplishing the task.
